          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

          This kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the number of blocks that can fit on the SM. This   
          kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The difference     
          between calculated theoretical (33.3%) and measured achieved occupancy (2.1%) can be the result of warp       
          scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between    
          warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide
