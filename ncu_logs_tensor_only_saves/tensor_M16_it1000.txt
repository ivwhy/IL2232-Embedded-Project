    OPT   This kernel grid is too small to fill the available resources on this device, resulting in only 0.0 full

          The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 1 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 80              
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

          This kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the number of blocks that can fit on the SM. This   
          kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The difference     
          between calculated theoretical (33.3%) and measured achieved occupancy (2.1%) can be the result of warp       
          scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between    
          warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide           
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on           
          optimizing occupancy.
