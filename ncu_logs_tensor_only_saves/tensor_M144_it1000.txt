    OPT   This kernel grid is too small to fill the available resources on this device, resulting in only 0.1 full      
          waves across all SMs. Look at Launch Statistics for more details.

    OPT   If you execute __syncthreads() to synchronize the threads of a block, it is recommended to have more than the 
          achieved 1 blocks per multiprocessor. This way, blocks that aren't waiting for __syncthreads() can keep the   
          hardware busy.

          This kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the number of blocks that can fit on the SM. This   
          kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The difference     
          between calculated theoretical (33.3%) and measured achieved occupancy (2.1%) can be the result of warp       
          scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between    
          warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide           
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on           
          optimizing occupancy.
